<h3><i>elements &amp; philosophies</h3></i>

Most of my ideas and philosophies on digital design can be found in these awesome articles:<br>

-  <a href="https://density.substack.com/p/dense-imagery"> dense imagery</a>
-  <a href="https://density.substack.com/p/digital-expressionism"> digital expressionism</a>
-  <a href="https://density.substack.com/p/the-hierarchy-of-digital-art"> the hierarchy of digital art</a>

but I just wanted to sum up some other ideas more closely related to game development and web design.

<h3><i>digital expressionism</i></h3>
Stochastic elements in digital art are excellent expressive elements that most designers <br>
avoid out of habit. Data compression artifacts, dropped frames, reverbed sound, these are<br>
cardinal sins in the professional enviroment, but should be embraced by digital artists regardless.<br><br>

Implementing stochastic elements into web design is tricky because the form of programming<br>
neccessetates precision. Its not impossible though, in fact, it's probably one of <br>the keys to the universe,
and really seperates the tourists from the natives of the digital landscape.

<h3><i>design that breathes</i></h3>

Everything breathes. Injcting this breathe into design is an organic way to bring it to life.<br>
The order book of any typical crypto exchange app is a great example. The buys and sells cascade<br>
back and forth, moving markets regardless of the indiidual, its got a mind of its own, and a breathe too.<br><br>
A more classic example of design that breathes is the resting animation of Commander Keen<br>
compared to that of Mario's 8-bit iteration.

Mario sits staic while Keen is active and dynamic even when you're not around. <br>
This simple animation gives the world a feeling like it exists beyond our interaction with it.<br>
Later iterations of Mario added resting animaitons, so nintendo seems to agree.
