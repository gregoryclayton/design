<h3><i>elements &amp; philosophies</h3></i>

Most of my ideas and philosophies on digital design can be found in these aesome articles:

- digital expressionism
- dense imagery
- the heirarchy of digital art

I just wanted to some up some other ideas more closely related to tech development and web design.
