<h3><i>elements &amp; philosophies</h3></i>

Most of my ideas and philosophies on digital design can be found in these awesome articles:<br>
- <a href="https://density.substack.com/p/digitalnatural"> digital/natural</a>
-  <a href="https://density.substack.com/p/digital-expressionism"> digital expressionism</a>
-  <a href="https://density.substack.com/p/dense-imagery"> digital expressionism</a>
-  <a href="https://density.substack.com/p/dense-imagery"> the hierarchy of digital art</a>

but I just wanted to sum up some other ideas more closely related to tech development and web design.

<h3><i>digital expressionism</i></h3>
Stochastic elements in digital art are excellent expressive elements that most designers <br>
avoid out of habit. Data compression artifacts, dropped frames, reverbed sound, these are<br>
cardinal sins in the professional enviroment, but should be embraced by digital artists regardless.<br><br>

Implementing stochastic elements into web design is tricky because the form of programming<br>
neccessetates precision. Its not impossible though, in fact, it's probably one of <br>the keys to the universe,
and really seperates the tourists from the natives of the digital landscape.
